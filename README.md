# Advent of Code 2020

### Compile
* compile the solution for each part using Make, e.g.:
  
    `cd day1`
  
    `make part1`

* some of the solutions use C++11 features:

    `export CXXFLAGS=-std=c++11`

### Run
* so far all the solutions take their input from stdin
* easiest way to run is by redirecting from a file:

    `./part1 < input.txt`
